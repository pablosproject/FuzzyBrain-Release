FuzzyBrain-Release
==================

This is the standalone version of the FuzzyBrain inference engine. To obtain the executable, you have to compile it by typing in the root folder of the project:

'''bash
    ./configure
    make
    make install (if you want to install it in your /usr/bin directory)
'

If you only do the first two step you can find the executable under the /bin subdir in the project directory.
